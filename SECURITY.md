| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

### 🔒 Private Reporting

**Please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security issues via:
- **Email**: security@phantasm0009.dev
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/phantasm0009/image-zen/security/advisories/new)

### 📝 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: What could an attacker potentially do?
3. **Reproduction Steps**: How to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, etc.
6. **Proof of Concept**: Code example or minimal test case

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: Within 2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

### 🏆 Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in the security advisory (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Listed in our Hall of Fame
- Eligible for bug bounty rewards (when program launches)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Input Validation
- All image inputs are validated before processing
- File size limits prevent DoS attacks
- Format validation prevents malicious files

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Only trusted, well-maintained packages

### Processing Safety
- Sandboxed image processing
- Memory limits to prevent OOM attacks
- Timeout protection for long-running operations

### Data Privacy
- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens locally
- No telemetry or tracking

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

When using @phantasm0009/image-zen:

### For Developers
```javascript
// Validate inputs before processing
try {
  const result = await zen.compress(userInput, options);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle validation errors gracefully
  console.error('Invalid input:', error.message);
}

// Set reasonable limits
const options = {
  maxWidth: 4096,
  maxHeight: 4096,
  quality: 80
};

// Use timeout for server environments
const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error('Processing timeout');
}, 30000);

try {
  const result = await zen.process(input, options);
  clearTimeout(timeout);
} catch (error) {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  throw error;
}
```

### For Server Deployments
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate file sizes before processing
- Use process isolation for untrusted inputs
- Monitor memory usage
- Log processing activities

### For CLI Usage
- Validate file permissions
- Use secure temporary directories
- Clean up temporary files
- Avoid processing untrusted files as root

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning:
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Dependency vulnerability alerts
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis
- **npm audit**: Package vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Continuous dependency monitoring

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before each release, we verify:
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Memory limits are properly enforced
- [ ] Timeout protections are in place
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All user inputs are properly sanitized

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:
- Performance issues that don't lead to DoS
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues in dependencies that we cannot control
- Vulnerabilities in outdated versions
